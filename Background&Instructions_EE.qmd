## Background

Diseases caused by pathogens vectored by blacklegged ticks are increasing both in number and geographic spread within the United States. The New England region (CT, MA, ME, RI, and VT) in particular has high rates of tick borne diseases. Project [ITCH](https://www.newvec.org/itch) (**I**s **T**ick **C**ontrol **H**elping?) led by New England Center of Excellence in Vector-borne Diseases (NEWVEC) researchers has found that within New England, there is enormous variation in how residents attempt to mitigate their risk of acquiring tick borne diseases at their own residence. Many residents use a combination of both home tick control and personal protective measures, others only use home tick control or personal protective measures, and many do not use any tick control or personal protective measures.

Interviews with New England residents on their approach to minimizing their risk of acquiring tick borne diseases revealed major differences in their approaches to the problem. Some residents choose their strategies based on a desire to minimize disease risk, others prioritize strategies that appear to minimize harm to the environment, and many more are attempting to minimize costs. Additionally, many residents are unclear on the efficacy of many tick control and personal protective measures, and oftentimes use strategies that may not be best at achieving their goals, or avoid strategies because of perceived harms.

Our goal is to develop a decision support tool to assist New England residents in choosing the best tick control and personal protective measures for them, based on their needs and goals.

## Brief Description of Decision Making Tool

To help NE residents choose the best tick control and personal protective measures for them, we will collect data on the performance of multiple ***alternatives*** (commonly used tick control and personal protective methods) at different ***objectives*** (goals when problem solving; e.g., increase efficacy or minimize costs).

The user of the tool can then weigh the different objectives according to their personal values and beliefs to find the alternatives that perform best at what they care about. For instance, someone that wants to minimize tick populations and encounters with ticks regardless of the cost may need to employ a different strategy than someone who cares about efficacy but does not want to spend much money or time on tick control and bite prevention.

## Role of Expert Elicitation

Given the lack of empirical data for alternatives performance of different objectives, and the difficulty in comparing existing empirical data collected in studies that can vary greatly in methods and context, the most consistent source of data to fill this decision making tool is expert opinion. We will be pooling data from multiple experts, which allows us to evaluate where there is consensus and where opinions vary greatly.

## Objectives

***Objectives:*** goals when trying to reduce tick borne disease risk at home

***Measurement:*** a means to evaluate an alternatives performance of an objective in a quantitative or qualitative manner

| O4 | Minimize financial costs | Cost of tick control or personal protective measure in USD per year. | Scale: \$0 — $\geq$\$5000 USD | Scale based on [Schulze et al. 2023](https://academic.oup.com/jme/article/60/5/1048/7237349) |
| O5 | Minimize time spent | Hours required to effectively deploy tick control or personal protective measure per year (includes labor hours for paid work) | Scale: 0 - 75 hrs |  |

| 1 | Do nothing | Use no tick control  or personal protective measures |
| 2 | Mow often | Maintain short lawn habitat |

| 15 | Natural personal protective spray/lotion | Apply personal protective spray or loton with natural active ingredients (i.e., 25b exempt products based on botanical oils or other natural origin ingredients) following manufacturer instructions with regards to amount and timing when outside in tick habitat. |

## Instructions for Experts

Focusing exclusively on blacklegged ticks, experts will provide three values for the dataset for each alternative $\times$ objective combination (300 total values), a confidence estimate for each combination, and will have opportunities to provide additional information for each combination.

For each alternative $\times$ objective combination, we would like experts to envision an average NE residence or resident, where an alternative has the best chance of working. In our end tool we will have users filter out alternatives irrelevant to them or their property (e.g., remove deer fencing as an option for those with non-forested properties, and pet treatments for those without outdoor pets).

### Input Values

To capture uncertainty in expert estimates, we would like experts to provide us with a range for their mean estimate of an alternative's performance of an objective (using the measurement provided), as well as an estimate of the mean.

-   **Minimum of Range:** The lowest value you think the mean could be
-   **Maximum of Range:** The highest value you think the mean could be
-   **Mean:** Within the range, what you think the mean actually is

***Note:*** We are not asking for you to provided the full range of potential values for a measurement, but a range of your estimate of the mean (i.e., the lowest number of ticks collected at a property with no tick control methods is 0, but the lowest estimate of the average number of ticks collected would be higher). Additionally, we do not expect the data to be normally distributed, so your point estimate of the mean does not need to be centered within the range.

### Confidence Estimates + Additional Information

To better understand the values an expert provides, as well as the sources of uncertainty within the data collected, we would like experts to characterize their confidence in their estimates for each alternative $\times$ objective combination on a percent scale, where 0 is completely not confident and 100 is completely confident.

We then have provided opportunities for experts to explain why they may lack confidence (or have very high confidence) in an estimate. We are particularly interested in knowing if a lack of confidence derives from unfamiliarity with a particular combination, or a general lack of data on a combination. We provided an additional box for experts to provide any other comments or questions on an alternative x objective combination.

## Common Questions

-   What type of property should I envision when evaluating an alternative?
    -   Envision a residence in New England with a yard that contains both lawn and forest edge.
-   What should I do if I am completely unfamiliar with an alternative?
    -   If you do not recognize an alternative, you can either input a value based on the description of the alternative and place your confidence very low (\<10%) with a note that says "Not familiar with alternative" or you can skip inputting data for that alternative.
